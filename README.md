# Flappy_bird_circuit
Using an analog circuit to play flappy bird. The idea is to convert a trained neural network into an analog circuit. The neural network is trained using a genetic algorithm in python.

### Current development state:
Created the game in pygame
<br/>
Used the library [deap](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) to train the model using a genetic algorithm
<br/>
Used the library [ahkab](https://github.com/ahkab/ahkab) to simulate the circuit used to play flappy bird. This circuit now accomplishes perfect play
